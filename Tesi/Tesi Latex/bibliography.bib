abstract = {This paper aims to identify the causes for the rejections of Boring Tool Holders (BTH) and develop a process control plan. From the CTQ characteristics, high rejection rates were due to the variations in key size and bore size dimensions. Define-Measure-Analyse-Improve-Control (DMAIC) approach was adopted to solve the problem. Data was collected and X-bar R control charts were drawn. The process was found not to be in statistical control. Fishbone diagram was constructed, and the root causes were narrowed down to tool wear and improper clamping of angular vise. Corrective actions were taken to make sure the angular vise was clamped properly and the tool life was monitored. This led to the process being in statistical control and thus, process capability analysis was conducted. All the values were found to be within the specification limits. The obtained Cpk values were 1.09 and 1.15 for key size and bore size respectively. This was later institutionalized by developing a process control plan that constituted the control stage.}

abstract = {In this paper, the selected problems related of modern quality monitoring and quality control in Polish companies have been presented. It has been found that monitoring of production processes is a necessary element of a company's proquality policy. Such an approach is connected with the continuous improvement of a company. Possibility of usage of statistical techniques of quality estimation process has been discussed. For this purpose, control charts type X-R and also calculation of index quality capability of process Cp; Cpk are created. Upon analysis suitable example has been shown, that their application permits to avoidance of many production defects already on the stage of production.}
