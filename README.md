<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

This interactive dashboard was developed with the goal of controlling and reducing scrap in a production process. By filtering from a date or a measurement, it is possible to view the production time series, box plots, distributions, and process capability indices (CP, CPK, PP, PPK) useful for product scrap prevention.
