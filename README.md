# About The Project

### Thesis Result -> Qlik Sense Dashboard
This interactive dashboard was developed with the goal of controlling and reducing scrap in a production process. By filtering from a date or a measurement, it is possible to view the production time series, box plots, distributions, and process capability indices (CP, CPK, PP, PPK) useful for product scrap prevention.

#### Thesis Project
This thesis concerns the analysis of the process related to the production of innerliner, as the component that covers the tire.
The purpose of the work is the study of how to prevent internal production waste at Pirelli's plant. The methodology used was to monitor product quality on an ongoing basis; consequent to a thorough understanding of the company's policy of managing nonconforming products, i.e., products that do not meet the required specifications.
The first phase of the research consisted of a thorough analysis of a series of samples related to innerlinner production. Subsequently, through an identification of the causes of variability and control of the CP and CPK process indices, an attempt was made to understand how to obtain products that conform to the technical specifications established in the control.
The business goal is to ensure that the production and control process is able to able to ensure product conformity.
